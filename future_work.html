        <h2><center>Considered colour scheme</center></h2>
        <br>
        <center> This colour paltte is intended to tie in with the name of the website and character - The Feral Jalapeno. The colour also ties in with the character and their views. Generally the character reflects on readings and takes on controvertial or heated topics as the blogs progress. The starting point to this is the first blog on the browser wars.</center>

        This rough outline is essentially the aim for the Home Page. Under the " THE FERAL JALAPENO" will be tabs that, when clicked on, will lead to the relative pages. e.g, clicking on the art tab will open up a page displaying the characters timeline of art posted. clicking the social tabs will open a page with various social medias that can also be interacted with, leading to actual social pages.
        <br>
        the two ovals on the sides represent two images of the character on either side. when scrolling down, there will be a recent updates. The squares represent any recent uploads made on the site. there will only be 3 recent updates shown on the homepage. These updates will be contained in rectangular blocks that when clicked on, will move to the actual page containing the full update. This serves as a preview of a recent update.

            The image of the character may change but for now this image serves as an example to portray the general asethtics aimed towards the character. The colours of the character tie in the the colour scheme intended for the website. As said in the colour scheme, the characters asethtics are meant to link to how they discuss and view the information in the readings. The intention is to almost show that the character doesn't mind addressing social and political issues that many people tend to avoid. The goal is to push and dissect the social and political aspects of the course material and link it to a South African perspective. Specifically from a south asian perspective.
