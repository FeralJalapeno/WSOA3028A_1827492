       <p>So, the Browser wars … <br><br>
        Essentially the story is that some undergrad students at the university of Illinois had a goal to change the clutter of the world wide web. They wanted to make all the information easily accessible. They achieved this goal in 1994 
        and launched the Mosaic browser. Now, a browser is a software application used to locate and display webpages. They did exist prior to 1993 but the Mosaic browser was different. It gained instant popularity because of its user-friendly 
        design and it’s use of colour. The Mosaic browser is the literal foundation of almost all web browsing we know of today.

    <h2><center>Why was Netscape Revolutionary?</center></h2>
       <p>Besides the simplicity of the browser’s point and click system, it offered something more important – security.</p>

       <p> Netscape Navigator, version 1.0, worked with engineer, Kipp Hickman, which provided the browser with unpresented security. The browser pioneered SSL protocol which established and encrypted a link between browser and server. This allowed for consumer protection. The underlying technology of SSL powers todays security standard – TLS (transport layer security). This was a solid method of authenticating two end points and having a secure connection.</p>
        
        <p>Netscape Navigator, version 2.0, released soon after. This version functioned faster and incorporated Java applets which then allowed for plug-ins (a software component that adds another feature to an existing computer program). The browser had millions of users and had 80% market share.</p>

        <center><h2>INTERPRETING THE LAYOUT OF WEBPAGES</h2></center>
        <br>
        <center><h3>in the ethical sense</h3></center> 
        <p> An interesting article by L. Francisco-Revilla and J. Crow, <em> Interpreting the layput of Web Pages </em> , discusses web page layout on an ethical sense. The article states how most sites utilise a modular layout since it “allows authors to present clearly large amounts of information in a single page.”  Now, sighted people can digest and process these complex layouts with ease. However, the ethical aspect I mentioned involves the visually impaired. </P>
