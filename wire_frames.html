       <p> This rough outline is essentially the aim for the Home Page. Under the " THE FERAL JALAPENO" will be tabs that, when clicked on, will lead to the relative pages. e.g, clicking on the art tab will open up a page displaying the characters timeline of art posted. clicking the social tabs will open a page with various social medias 
           that can also be interacted with, leading to actual social pages.
        </p>
       <p> the two ovals on the sides represent two images of the character on either side. when scrolling down, there will be a recent updates. The squares represent any recent uploads made on the site. there will only be 3 recent updates shown on the homepage. These updates will be contained in rectangular blocks that when clicked on,
            will move to the actual page containing the full update. This serves as a preview of a recent update.</p>

            <p>The idea for this wire frame was to have all the blog posts appear here. Each block represents a preview of each blog. The small squares 
                would ideally be used for the art pieces uploaded. When clicked on ( any block) it would take you to a new page with the full blog post. 
            This layout is the most ideal for my aesthetic purposes but now I feel conflicted with my design choices and have opted for just a plain, linear layout.
