       <p> This rough outline is essentially the aim for the Home Page. Under the " THE FERAL JALAPENO" will be tabs that, when clicked on, will lead to the relative pages. e.g, clicking on the art tab will open up a page displaying the characters timeline of art posted. clicking the social tabs will open a page with various social medias 
           that can also be interacted with, leading to actual social pages.
        </p>
       <p> the two ovals on the sides represent two images of the character on either side. when scrolling down, there will be a recent updates. The squares represent any recent uploads made on the site. there will only be 3 recent updates shown on the homepage. These updates will be contained in rectangular blocks that when clicked on,
            will move to the actual page containing the full update. This serves as a preview of a recent update.</p>

            <p>The idea for this wire frame was to have all the blog posts appear here. Each block represents a preview of each blog. The small squares 
                would ideally be used for the art pieces uploaded. When clicked on ( any block) it would take you to a new page with the full blog post. 
                The layout displays as muchinformation to the user as possible - giving them a variety of choice on what to read/ look at further without
                navigating throughout various webpages. with this layout, all the various topics have a previewed piece which allows the user to decide if they want
                to look into it further or not.
            This layout is the most ideal for my aesthetic purposes but now I feel conflicted with my design choices and have opted for just a plain, linear layout.

         <center><h2>WHY I'M CONFLICTED WITH USING THESE DESIGNS</h2></center>
         <p> If you refer to my blog post about <a href= blogs_Interpreting_the_layout_of_Web_Pages.html> Interpreting the layout of Web Pages</a> you'll see
        that the ethics around web page layout is discussed. The designs that I have interest in are only well suited for sighted users and not
    users with impaired vision. Now, I just feel conflicted as to whether I should design my pages to be effective and visually pleasing to sighted users
or should I be catering to users who aren't sighted. Due to this, I've opted to put the design on hold and rather leave the layout as simple as possible.</p>
