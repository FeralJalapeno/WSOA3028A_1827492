        <h1>Wire Frames</h1>
        <h2>Inital ideas</h2>
        
        <p><img src= Images\Wire_Frame_Home_Page.png  width= 300 length =800 border=5 ></p>
        
       <p> This rough outline is essentially the aim for the Home Page. Under the " THE FERAL JALAPENO" will be tabs that, when clicked on, will lead to the relative pages. e.g, clicking on the art tab will open up a page displaying the characters timeline of art posted. clicking the social tabs will open a page with various social medias 
           that can also be interacted with, leading to actual social pages.
        </p>
       <p> the two ovals on the sides represent two images of the character on either side. when scrolling down, there will be a recent updates. The squares represent any recent uploads made on the site. there will only be 3 recent updates shown on the homepage. These updates will be contained in rectangular blocks that when clicked on,
            will move to the actual page containing the full update. This serves as a preview of a recent update.</p>
            <p><img src=  Images\modular_wire_frame.jpg width= 300 length =800 border=5 ></p>
            <p>The idea for this wire frame was to have all the blog posts appear here. Each block represents a preview of each blog. The small squares 
                would ideally be used for the art pieces uploaded. When clicked on ( any block) it would take you to a new page with the full blog post. 
                The layout displays as muchinformation to the user as possible - giving them a variety of choice on what to read/ look at further without
                navigating throughout various webpages. with this layout, all the various topics have a previewed piece which allows the user to decide if they want
                to look into it further or not.
            This layout is the most ideal for my aesthetic purposes but now I feel conflicted with my design choices and have opted for just a plain, linear layout.            
         </p>
         <h2>WHY I'M CONFLICTED WITH USING THESE DESIGNS</h2>
         <p> If you refer to my blog post about <a href= blogs_Interpreting_the_layout_of_Web_Pages.html> Interpreting the layout of Web Pages</a> you'll see
        that the ethics around web page layout is discussed. The designs that I have interest in are only well suited for sighted users and not
    users with impaired vision. Now, I just feel conflicted as to whether I should design my pages to be effective and visually pleasing to sighted users
or should I be catering to users who aren't sighted. Due to this, I've opted to put the design on hold and rather leave the layout as simple as possible.</p>

<h2>CURRENT DESIGN</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, I genuinely overestimated my skills and time when it came to the design of these webpages. As much as I would love to have interactive columns and blocks, it proved to be very tricky for me when I tried implementing it. I tried using an external CSS framework but learning how to work around the framework was too complex (for me ) and involved making major changes across the entire website.</p>
<p>Personally, I would rather opt for something I understand than follow a tutorial and have it working – but not understanding how or why its working. Due to this, I designed the website based off what I knew and understood. It is very simple, but I feel as if it reflects the character and their aesthetics quite well. </p>
<h2>Design and Aesthetics</h2>
<p>Throughout the website, the same colour scheme and images are used. The two images you see on the sides of the page link to the original wire frame where I wanted to images on the left and right sides and then information in the middle of them. The information I decided on for the homepage is my current Twitter feed. I did this for a very specific reason, that reason being that I believe you can tell a lot about a person just by going through their Twitter feed. By looking at what Tweets someone likes, retweets and tweets, you can tell a lot about who they are as a person- without even asking them directly. An example would be J.K Rowling. Besides being a famous author of the Harry Potter books, she has been brought into light as a transphobic person purely based on her Twitter activity. Her liking of transphobic tweets already tell us where she stands in the topic. Therefore, I have put my Twitter feed as the only main aspect on the Home Page. Users can look through my resent activity and therefore get to know me as a person, i.e where my interests and opinions lie.</p>
<p>The images seen are meant to represent the characters culture and interests. The images are very culturally themed and are meant to show the characters south-Asian identity in a aesthetic manner. The art also comes from one of my favourite artists, Phobes, who gains attraction by drawing these culturally specific characters. Smaller images are used in the blog post lists to reference/link to what the blog post is discussing. For example, the image used for the Mass Effect blog post features a character from the game. This was purely just for my own enjoyment of seeing pretty art as I scrolled down the list.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, my skills are extremely poor. I had to keep the navigation bar simple and to my understanding so in case something went wrong, I could potentially manage to fix it. The bar is very traditional a simple. It displays the website name as well as the main points to navigate to. For my blog lists, I really enjoyed having the fixed images in the background and being able to scroll down to each blog post from each week. </p>
<p>Keeping things simple was mainly due to a lack of technical skill on my part. Most of the effort went into creating some interesting blog posts that linked to my interests. I decided to take on an additional major this year and the world pandemic did not make things any easier. The workload for putting in time to attend to each course individually became extremely time consuming. Certain things had to be prioritized over others. With this, blog posts were the priority whereas the coding was not. A lot of time was wasted figuring out things with poor results where more of tht time could’ve been spent on creating more blog posts. As an individual, I prefer theory and academic writing. I really do enjoy discussing social issues, especially in topics people least expect them to be. </p>
<p>The colour scheme links to the sacred colours in Hinduism, again this links to the characters South Asian culture and aspects. The saffron (yellow) is known to be a very sacred color. It symbolizes purity. You find it worn by Buddhist monks. Red is one of the more significant colours in Hinduism, that is why I decided to make my navigation bar this red colour. These two colours are made prominent in encapsulating the text in certain webpages but are also represented by the two images of characters on the left and right side of the web pages.</p>
