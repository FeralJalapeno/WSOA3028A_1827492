    <h2><center> Want to create a Web Robot?</center></h2>
        <h3><center>Things you should consider first</center></h3>
        <br>
       <p>Sometimes creation can seem like a good thing but it is important to bear in mind that just because something can be created, doesn’t mean it should. Technology created needs to be wary of its ethical implications. For now, let’s just briefly look at the aspects to consider when creating web robots.</p>
       <p><strong> What do you want this web robot to do?</strong> 
        <br>
        The best use is doing any task that would take an insane amount of time for a human to do manually. The goal should be that this web robot will do this manual task automatically. This results in a major amount of time being saved.</p>
       <p><strong>What steps does this web robot need to follow in order to perform the tasks required of it?</strong> 
        <br>
        The goal should be that you want the bot to complete the task in the minimum amount of time as possible. You should plan it well enough so that you can achieve an efficient program that works well and is error free. This mostly relies on your programming and scripting. You should research and spend time looking at what language will be better suited for your bots purpose.</p>
       <p><strong>Will this bot you’re creating need manual intervention to complete it’s required tasks or is it completely automated?</strong> 
        <br>
        This is important to consider as you’ll need to decide whether you still want a human to manually work along with the bot or if you want the bot to function by itself. If it requires human intervention, it may make the task you wish to complete through the bot more time consuming. </p>
       <p><strong>Consider whether the bot needs to run inside a web browser in order to function.</strong> 
        <br>
         IF it operates on a remote server you should be aware of whether others to operate it.</p>
