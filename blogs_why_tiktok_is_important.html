        <center><h1>WHY TIKTOK IS IMPORTANT</h1></center>
<center><h2>There’s a reason why no one really cares about iconic celebrities on the app</h2></center> <hr>

<p>Before you cringe - just give me a chance to explain. Tiktok is a rapidly growing platform. The focus of this platform is on how  its main feed often surfaces everyday users — aka, amateurs — doing something cute, funny or clever. Ordinary people have gained a sense of popularity and have been recognised as creative contributors just by creating content on the app. </p>
<p>“Digital Storytelling therefore works to ‘remediate’ vernacular creativity in new media contexts: it is based on everyday communicative practices – telling personal stories, collecting, and sharing personal images – but remixed with the textual idioms of television and film; and transformed into publicly accessible culture through the use of digital tools for production and distribution.” ( Jean Burgess, p.g 3) </p>
<p>This is exactly how TikTok operates as a medium. Majority of the content (especially content that goes viral ) is based off of people just sharing their personal stories.
People make short skits of their everyday lives that relay a sense of relatability to the audience. At the same time, these stories are told using the TikTok sound and video features for added humour. 
These videos are then publicly available on the app to people across the globe. </p>
<p>“In this light, I will continue to be very interested in tracking the emergence of initiatives and technologies that not only re-mediate vernacular creativity, but that also afford ordinary people opportunities to see themselves and, importantly, each other as creative authors with a legitimate claim to a space in the cultural public sphere.” – ( Jean Burgess p.g 4)</p>
<p>This is one of the main aspects that TikTok seems to give it’s users. 
The platform has given ordinary, amatuer creators the opportunity to stand out as a creative author. This means that ordinary people gain a sense of fame/popularity from the content they produce. This allows them to “claim a space in the cultural public sphere” of the internet. </p>
<p> <center><h4>SO WHY THE HELL IS THIS IMPORTANT</h4></center></p>
An article by Sean Wang states the following: <br><br>
“Almost all videos on the platform are user generated. Tik Tok did a great job in getting normal users creating videos.” This shows how majority of the content on the platform is created by normal users of the app. It allows for people to see themselves as creative contributors as well as others to see and validates this.
The article discusses a term called “mimicry” which essentially means people end up making videos because they see others making videos. Users feel the urge/ inspiration to create a video after seeing someone else create something that entertained them.
“After creating such videos, users also tend to reshare it on major social networks”Like with most social platforms, content is shared over a distributed. Most TikTok videos gain more popularity outside the platform on things like Instagram or Youtube.</p>
<p>Many users of TikTok who gained creative recognition through the app have managed to make a financial success out of it. Due to their popularity they are able to do sponsored videos and essentially make money through a free application.This allows for individuals to make money through being their creative selves - without having their creativity be taken advantage of. Artists therefore can express themselves and can have “a legitimate claim to a space in the cultural public sphere.” </p>
