In this blog post I discuss the article <a href= https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1557914.1557943> Interpreting the layout of Web Pages</a>
in terms of ethics. The ethical aspect covers Web Pages and their lack of service/ design for the visually impaired.
</P>
<p> An interesting article by L. Francisco-Revilla and J. Crow, <em> Interpreting the layput of Web Pages </em> , discusses web page layout on an ethical sense. The article states how most sites utilise a modular layout since it “allows authors to present clearly large amounts of information in a single page.” (Francisco-Revilla and Crow, 2009, p.157). Now, sighted people can digest and process these complex layouts with ease. However, the ethical aspect I mentioned involves the visually impaired. </P>
    <p> This paper states that current assistive technologies, such as screen readers meant to help the visually impaired, cannot digest and process these complex layouts. As the complexity in the web page layout increases, the interpretation process is extended. Web sites exist so that they can present their contents to users in a convenient, interesting, and understandable manner. </p>
    <p> “Designing Web pages that meet these requirements is especially challenging given the amount and complexity of the information, as well as the different affordances and constraints of online digital information, such as interactivity and dynamic content.” (Francisco-Revilla and Crow, 2009, p.157) – This statement really resonates with me. Currently I am learning how to design and code a blog AND DAMN … I am constantly thinking about whether my web pages are going to have an effective layout in the end.  </p>
    <p>The article discusses how most news and shopping web sites often use modular layouts. “Modular layouts use a combinations of vertical and horizontal shapes to package the information. Modular layouts provide a clean and simple appearance”. (Francisco-Revilla and Crow, 2009, p.157-158) The article further discusses how this layout improves legibility and saves time in the web page creation process. It provides an advantage to advertising opportunities and, the most important point, it is preferred by readers. BUT this only refers to sighted users. “ This approach is highly effective for sighted users, but it also places visually impaired users at a great disadvantage. “ (Francisco-Revilla and Crow, 2009, p.158). This is due to the screen readers not being able to interpret the information presented in these modular layouts. These layouts are multi-dimensional and screen readers interact with information in a unidimensional approach. This gives visually impaired users an extreme limitation and restricts them from having any access to understanding the web pages. </p>
    <p>Examples of modular layouts:</p>

    <p> Now, I want to discuss the ethics around this problem. Many people argue that visually impaired web users are in an extreme minority. According to the World Health Organization, only 0.5% of the entire world population is blind. That percentage may seem like nothing but that makes up 39 million people … Unfortunately, in our society, we are often clouded with our own experiences which severely influences us in our work. In many cases, people with a disability are never considered when it comes to designing and creating something. This results in people with disability being excluded and even disadvantaged. The reason this problem exists is because creators aren’t aware. In most cases, unless creators were previously exposed to a personal situation where someone they knew was excluded from utilising a creation due to their disability, they will not consciously be aware of this when making their own things. Yes, people with disability are placed in the minority BUT it is ethically wrong to exclude a human being based on their disability, regardless of their numbers.</p>
    <p> People tend to be so consumed by their privilege that they don’t realise how privileged they are. Just because we aren’t aware of issues or share the same experiences – it doesn’t mean that these issues don’t exist. If most teams just had one disabled person on their team, they’d be aware of these issues and have valid input on how to effectively cater for people with disability.   </p>
    <p>This issue doesn’t just apply to people with disability, it applies to everything from race to cultures. Having a variety of people on a creation team lowers the chances of these teams creating something that will end up being problematic to a certain group of people. </p>
