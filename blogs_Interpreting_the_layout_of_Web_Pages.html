In this blog post I discuss the article <a href= https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1557914.1557943> Interpreting the layout of Web Pages</a>
in terms of ethics. The ethical aspect covers Web Pages and their lack of service/ design for the visually impaired.
</P>
<p> An interesting article by L. Francisco-Revilla and J. Crow, <em> Interpreting the layput of Web Pages </em> , discusses web page layout on an ethical sense. The article states how most sites utilise a modular layout since it “allows authors to present clearly large amounts of information in a single page.”  Now, sighted people can digest and process these complex layouts with ease. However, the ethical aspect I mentioned involves the visually impaired. </P>
