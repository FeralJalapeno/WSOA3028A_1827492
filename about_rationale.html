            <p>The character <strong>The Feral Jalapeno</strong> is mainly an extension of myself. Also, I just really like that name and it was already used for all my socials ‚Äì so why not use it üòä</p>
            <p>The character is a South African-Indian that attends university. The topics of privilege and ethics are the focus that you can find coming up in majority of the blogs. The intention is to address these issues and highlight them amongst theoretical discussions. The topic of ethics and privilege is very important to this character and the goals is to push these social aspects in a South African perspective. Specifically, from a south Asian perspective</p>
            <h3>BUT WHY ARE THESE TOPICS OF ETHICS AND PRIVILIGE IMPORTANT TO ME</h3>
            <p> These topics are important because, personally, I have observed how people who tend to come from a place of privilege, are often ignorant to others who are not. People have the idea that if something is not directly affecting them or if they do not see it ‚Äì then it doesn‚Äôt exist. Being South-Asian myself, I struggle to get along with other south Asians in South Africa. Why? Because majority of them are ignorant to issues surrounding poverty, racism and its link to colonialism and slavery. The only ones who tend be ignorant to these topics are ones who come from an extremely privileged background. They have no care to social issues because they find that it does not affect them. The attitude involves the sense of ‚Äúif I‚Äôm rich and comfortable now, why should I care about everyone else who isn‚Äôt‚Äù. Now, this mentally is not just restricted to one race, it is open to everyone. But this is personal to ME and MY racial group because it affects me deeply and prevents me from even getting along with my own family </p>
            
            <p>In the south Asian community, many people praise and value people with a fairer skin tone. Again, most of them are ignorant to the fact that this is an ideology carried over by the effects of colonialism. Often, when I‚Äôve tried to explain this to them, they get offended and claim ‚Äú not it has nothing to do with colonialism‚Äù but then my question is THEN WHY DO YOU THINK HAVING FAIR SKIN IS BETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE??? I understand that these are intense topics and I‚Äôm not saying we need to look at the past and be angry ‚Äì I‚Äôm saying people need to be aware of things so that they can understand their sense of privilege.</p>
            <h3>EVEN IF YOU‚ÄùRE NOT SOUTH ASIAN -THESE ISSUES STILL APPLY </h3>
            <p>Now, those were topics that influenced me into becoming interested in addressing them in the first place. It would be difficult for a non- south Asian person or even a south-Asian person who has not experienced the same thing as me to even understand where I‚Äôm coming from. </p>
            <p> So let me give you a more understandable example ‚Äì look at people and their behaviour due the COVID-19 outbreak. Thousands of people were clearing the shelves of groceries, from toilet paper to Oros ‚Ä¶ OROS ! People knew that the government warned the country against panic buying and that it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous, yet they still queued outside stores for hours and cleared the shelves. But why did they do that? Because they can. Because they have the finances to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries. Because they have the privilege to be selfish. It is a privilege to have the ability to clear out a stores stock and leave a person who desperately needs a limited number of essentials to be stranded with nothing. People don‚Äôt understand and may not agree with this, but it‚Äôs true. The only reason you would overstock your cupboards and potentially disadvantage someone else who cannot do the same ‚Äì is because you financially are able to do so. </p>
            <p>The issues of people being consumed and clouded by their privilege often results in them disadvantaging people who aren‚Äôt as privileged. The sad thing is that most people aren‚Äôt even aware of what they‚Äôre doing or when they are aware, they don‚Äôt care ‚Ä¶ because it doesn‚Äôt affect them. This type of ignorance exists everywhere, from web design to fashion runways. The goal is to slowly address these issues and bring them up where they are evident.</p>
