    <h2><center>Why was Netscape Revolutionary?</center></h2>
    <p>Besides the simplicity of the browser’s point and click system, it offered something more important – security.</p>

    <p> Netscape Navigator, version 1.0, worked with engineer, Kipp Hickman, which provided the browser with unpresented security. The browser pioneered SSL protocol which established and encrypted a link between browser and server. This allowed for consumer protection. The underlying technology of SSL powers todays security standard – TLS (transport layer security). This was a solid method of authenticating two end points and having a secure connection.</p>
     
     <p>Netscape Navigator, version 2.0, released soon after. This version functioned faster and incorporated Java applets which then allowed for plug-ins (a software component that adds another feature to an existing computer program). The browser had millions of users and had 80% market share.</p>
