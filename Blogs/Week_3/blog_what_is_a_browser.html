<h1>WHAT IS A BROWSER</h1>

<p>If you open Google Chrome, type “ what is a browser” into the URL and hit search- the first thing you see is a definition stating that a browser is “ a person who looks casually through publications or websites or at goods for sale”. So essentially browsers are made up entirely of the south Asian community … since these uncles and aunties are always hunting around different stores to see where they can buy the cheapest jar of peanut butter. </p>
<p>Don’t worry, I won’t be discussing that kind of browser. An article by Computer Hope defines a browser as “ a software program to present and explore content on the World Wide Web.” All this content, including the media such as videos and pictures are all connected using hyperlinks and URI’s ( Uniform Resource Identifiers). A hyperlink is simply an icon, graphic or a piece of text that links to another file. The internet is made up entirely of hyperlinks. A URI is a reference to other addresses that apply to registered protocols. URLs are forms of URI.</p>
<p>The first browser, WorldWideWeb, was created by Tim Berners-Lee
The first graphical browser that is responsible for bringing popularity to the Internet was Mosaic. For more in-depth information on that, check out my other blog posts:  </p>

<p>In order to operate a browser, you need a device that meets the minimum system requirements to run the specific browser, as well as an internet connection. Each browser has a navigation tool bar. This assists in navigating around the internet. Check out the image below, it shows the various iterations the navigation tool bar has undergone. Even though the appearance and functionality of it has changed significantly, the navigation arrows and address bar are most likely never going to be removed.</p>
