<h1>WHAT IS A URL</h1>
<p>Many people, including myself, think that a URL is the same as a domain name. I’ll have you know that I don’t think that anymore … because I’ve done my research. A URL is NOT the same as a domain name. </p>

   <p>An article from Verisign.com briefly explains the difference between a URL and a domain name. Since the two terms are used interchangeably, it’s not surprising that people get confused between the two. This makes me feel like less of an idiot. Anyway, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator.  </p>
<p>Computers reply on an IP address to link and essentially communicate with other computers and networks. These IP addresses are long sequences of numbers and letters. Every device that connects to the internet has one. </p>
<p>Typing out these long sequences, to navigate around the internet, is not realistic. It would be too time consuming and tedious. Hence, domain names were created as a sort of nickname for these IP addresses</p>
 <p>So the URL includes the domain name as well as other information required to create a web address that will direct a browser to a specific web page.</p>

<p>An article from Themeisle.com explains URLs in more depth. The article states that “a URL is the location of a specific website, page, or file on the Internet.”  This is short and sweet … if only my academic readings got to the point just as clearly and quickly. </p>
<p>So a URL is made up of three main parts : The protocol, The domain name and The path. The protocol refers to the first part of a web address- the http:// and the https//. Many users overlook this element, but it is very important. It tells the browser how to communicate with a website’s server. This is required so that information can be received as well as be sent across. Most sites have a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). There has been a recent mass use of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). This protocol does the same thing as the other one but, it is much more secure. This is why you see browsers utilize the green security padlock with URLs that utilise HTTPS.</p>
<p> The domain name is made up of two smaller sections. The Top-Level Domain (TLD) which refers to the .com or .net designator at the end of the domain name. The choice of TLD should be easy to remember if you want to create a website for your business or something you want people to visit a bit. Using the .com TLD is the best option since many people are already familiar with it. But there are hundreds to choose from- many of which are industry specific. </p>
<p>The path is the part of the URL that comes after the TLD. It’s called the path because it directs the browser to a specific page. That’s literally all it is … sorry it’s doesn’t go as deep as the protocol.</p>
<p> The article also gives a very nice, short and sweet recap:</p>
<p>1. The protocol – HTTP or HTTPS.<br>
2. The domain name (including the TLD) that identifies a site.<br>
3. The path leading to a specific web page. </p>
