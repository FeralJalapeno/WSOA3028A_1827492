       <p>So, the Browser wars … <br><br>
        Essentially the story is that some undergrad students at the university of Illinois had a goal to change the clutter of the world wide web. They wanted to make all the information easily accessible. They achieved this goal in 1994 
        and launched the Mosaic browser. Now, a browser is a software application used to locate and display webpages. They did exist prior to 1993 but the Mosaic browser was different. It gained instant popularity because of its user-friendly 
        design and it’s use of colour. The Mosaic browser is the literal foundation of almost all web browsing we know of today.
        
    </p>
    <p>
        After all this, Jim Clark (as in the same Jim Clark who rendered the dinosaurs for Jurassic Park – THE DINOSAURS) joined forces with the Illinois students and formed Mosaic Communications Corporation. BUT they ran into a major issue, the University still had intellectual property rights to the original Mosaic (which is still in effect today… I don’t know about you but that seems awfully petty) so naturally the university sued them for intellectual property infringement. They could not do anything but settle for the name Netscape and start coding from scratch.

    </p>
    <p>
        In mid-December, version 1.0 of Netscape navigator was released. It was a massive success. Besides having a simple point and click method, it also provided unpresented security. Netscape pioneered SSL (secure socket layer) protocol which established and encrypted the link between browser and server. This allowed privacy and consumer protection when submitting things like credit card numbers. In August 1995, Netscape went public with version 2.0 and had 80% of the market share. But the point is not on their success, it’s the attention they attracted from their success.

    </p>
    <p>
        Here’s the deal, in 1995 Microsoft suddenly stole the limelight. Bill Gates publicly stated his intentions and goals – to destroy Netscape. They released Internet explorer 1.0. Ironically, this browser was built off some of the original Netscape Navigator. But how did that happen if the University of Illinois had intellectual property rights? Turns out, Microsoft had a licensed browser software from a company called Spyglass. This company brokered a deal with the university to license Mosaic and its underlying technology… sketchy if you ask me. The university wouldn’t allow the students who actually created the browser to even use anything associated with it … but let a company use it because they paid them. That’s absolutely terrible.

    </p>
    <p>
        In the end Bill Gates achieved his goal, to overthrow Netscape. Sadly, this was done by literally using the students original Mosaic creation against them. Their university is the true villain. An institute that was meant to help its students but rather chose to keep the students original work away from them and eventually sell them out for some financial gain. It’s disappointing to see how this university let down its very students, not just once- but twice.

        SO what was the point of this rant?
        <br>
        As a university student, I constantly have a fear that the university I attend could do something similar to me. Listen, I’m not saying I’m going to create something revolutionary, but what I am saying is that I’m afraid to try my absolute best. I’m afraid to create and work on half of my ideas I’m so passionate about. I’m afraid that an institution that’s meant to give me opportunity can end up taking away my potential success for their own personal gain.
