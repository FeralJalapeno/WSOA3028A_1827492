        <h1> A close reading of Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”</h1>
<p> The reading starts off with “Information has always had geography. It is from somewhere; about somewhere; it evolves and is transformed somewhere; it is mediated by networks, infrastructures, and technologies: all of which exist in physical, material places. These geographies of information about places matter because they shape how we are able to find and understand different parts of the world”( Graham, M. p.g80). This entire statement carries a large amount of truth. The paper uses a combination of existing statistics and data that has not been previously analysed to expand on this statement. It explores how information geographies have their own f=geographic distributions, access, participation, and representation.  The main point I want to look at is which geographical locations contribute and participate the most on the internet platforms and why this matters.</p>
<p> All information, from academic textbooks to fables and legends are adapted to a variation of local contexts and geographies. This information is vastly mobile in today’s era. This means that this information can reach different people from various geographical locations. The reading states that “  It is precisely this mobility and adaptability of information that provides the motivation to constrain the
mutability of information through the creation of what
Latour (1986) refers to as ‘immutable mobiles’: or
information that can be transported without significant
change to its inherent characteristics or meaning.“ (Graham, M. p.g 89) The example referred to is the printing press. The printing press is known to a revolutionary invention but not many people are aware of how much of an influence it would have on the concept of information.
The printing press created a cheap method of transporting information while limiting how its form could change. Governments and companies soon adopted the ICT-based non-proximate communication. This was because the ability to create shared understandings of information by non-proximate and asynchronous populations became vital. This led to information and power becoming extremely intertwined. </p>
<p> Now, that tells us how power and information are linked. We haven’t gone deeper into the paper yet, but I want you to think about that statement. Information and power are intertwined- having access or control to information gives you that power. If it still doesn’t make sense, think about universities as an example. In our society, we would view someone with a university degree more highly than someone with just a high school diploma. This is because one has more information- access to information- than the other. This makes them more “powerful” in our society, especially in terms of finance and work opportunity. Now, take that same university student and compare them to the professors who teach them. The professors are viewed at a higher regard because they have more information. The professors could be absolutely inadequate at their job and not display any concrete evidence of their supposed knowledge – but they will still have more power than the average student. This is just a very small and simple example, but it doesn’t cover much of the vital points.</p>
<p>The paper then explains that ‘Information about any location can be abstracted from it and placed in the relatively immutable form of printed paper: thus simultaneously fixing information to a physical object and untethering it to a locale, as this form can be easily moved through space.” This explains how the location ( the geography) of immutable mobiles , such as books and maps, greatly define the location of where this specific location information is referenced from. This mean that something like a book about foods from Japan (an immutable mobile)  will end up influencing what readers define and understand about Japan (the geography).</p>
<p>”ICTs have also facilitated an evolution of information beyond immutable mobiles through the creation of ‘(im)mutable augmentations’ characterised by the layering of dynamic information across and over geographic space” This leads to how specific geographies of information, are layered and defined by information where it’s immutability is dependent on who this information is associated with. The immutable augmentations matter because it influences how we understand different geographical locations. They are more than just representations of geographical location- they are part of that location itself. This geography of information has been used to control power for a long time. </p>
<p>The most important part of the paper discusses “ Geographies of access and enablement”. By understanding this, important points on the distribution of technologies and services that are required for digital communication, participation and representations become clear. Internet access is required in order to have most kinds of digital engagement. </p>

<p>The figure above shows information regarding the number of internet users and internet connects per country, since the 1990s. The term internet users refers to the population of the specific country that has access to the internet. The darker shades of colour represent higher levels of per capita internet usage. The distortion of the visuals highlights the countries level of concentration of users. So by looking at the image, you can see that China has the highest concentration of internet users but not the highest level of per capita internet usage. The paper points out how the combination of Asian countries has more internet users than Europe and and North America combined. It also points out that majority of the worlds largest internet nations, there is still room for growth. This is possible due to the large population numbers of these countries.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is how all but four countries with a penetration rate greater than 80% are in Europe. Latin America has as many internet users as America but has a lower penetration rate. It is definitely not a coincidence that majority of the locations with the highest penetration rates have a history of slavery and colonialism. Remember, this paper emphasises that knowledge/ access to information is power, thus internet accessibility and influence means power. Therefore, it’s not surprising that countries that were built off power exploitation have the highest penetration rates.</p>

<p>That all ties in with broadband affordability. The unevenness is the geography of internet access has been clarified. In addition to this problem, the cost of access to the internet varies across the globe. The image above displays the main point of the global digital divide- the financial requirement to be connected to the internet. Again, note how countries built off of slavery and colonialism have the lowest costs whereas majority of the countries they stole from and invaded have the highest costs. Just look at Africa. A continent that was ripped apart by white powers now has the highest concent5ration of high broadband subscription costs. The actual issue is the low incomes of the African population rather than the high broadband cost. Also note how countries that have a massive history of British colonialism now have a lower broadband subscription. This refers to places such as South Africa and India. Again, remember that access to information means power, therefore internet access means power.  </p>
<p>These two images provide the most important understandings when it comes to information geographies. It emphasizes the point that without the ability to connect to the internet- there is no possibility of participating and contributing towards how their specific geography is perceived by the rest of the world.</p>
