       <strong><h1>CHARACTER RATIONALE</h1></strong>
     
       <p> The Feral Jalapeno is a south-asian woman, living in South-Africa. Topics of ethics are highly prioritized and come up frequently throughout the blog posts.</p>
<p> These topics are explored in various locations and mediums, especially in places many people are unaware of. An example would be video games and how something like white supremacy is extremely evident in the industry. By addressing these issues, we can realize how much the effects of things like, colonialism and slavery, still taint majority of the world. Especially in aspects people tend to believe holds little to none of these issues </p>
<p>This is where my blog posts come in. I want to bring awareness to these problematic situations in our modern society. In my opinion, there are plenty of problems in a lot of things. These problems vary but there are a few that really get to me. An example would be the whole <a href="D:\Interactive Media\Interactive_Media\Git_Hub_Stuff\WSOA3028A_1827492\Blogs\Week_2\blogs_The_Browser_Wars.html" >browsers wars </a> situation. Many people know NOTHING about the browser wars, let alone what the first browser was. So, that means that many people are unaware of the fact that literal university students were taken advantage of and betrayed by their own university. And for what? For clout and money. </p>
<p> See, I’m not saying we need to harbour anger towards the past and demand repercussions to be made. I’m saying that it’s important to know how things work, why they exist and what exactly happened in order for it to get to what it is today. </p>
<p>Besides the technical and ethical stuff, I also love art and LOVE supporting artists. This is why you find blog posts about <a href="D:\Interactive Media\Interactive_Media\Git_Hub_Stuff\WSOA3028A_1827492\Blogs\Week_8\blog_supporting_artists.html" >supporting artists</a> and <a href="D:\Interactive Media\Interactive_Media\Git_Hub_Stuff\WSOA3028A_1827492\Blogs\Week_7\blogs_why_tiktok_is_important.html" >the importance of apps like TikTok</a>. Now, some artists and TikTok itself do harbour plenty of issues, but supporting artists is extremely important (and free ) and an app like TikTok is vital in our modern age. It gives ordinary the opportunity to make a creative mark and presence on the internet.</p>
<p> As a South Asian, living in South Africa, I have been made of many issues we face in this country. Many of which include racism and sexism. Because of this, I find it very important to be a woman of colour on the internet. It is important to educate and represent your race and culture in a world dominated by cultural and racial suppression. To express my South Asian heritage, I decorated my webpages with South-Asian women and include topics such as racism in a number of blog posts. In my <a href= "D:\Interactive Media\Interactive_Media\Git_Hub_Stuff\WSOA3028A_1827492\Blogs\Week_9\blogs_comics.html">comics blog post</a> you will see a mention of the adult, comic character - Savita Bhabhi. Although she is a character featured in an adult comic, she holds significant importance towards south Asian women. She stood as a figure who helped women see themselves as more than mere house wives only meant to serve their husbands (something that many women are unfortunately seen as). Savita Bhabhi caused women to become more excepting of their sexuality and let go of the sexist ideologies that surrounded them. </p>
    
            <h3>BUT WHY ARE THESE TOPICS OF ETHICS AND PRIVILIGE IMPORTANT TO ME</h3>
            <p> These topics are important because, personally, I have observed how people who tend to come from a place of privilege, are often ignorant to others who are not. People have the idea that if something is not directly affecting them or if they do not see it – then it doesn’t exist. Being South-Asian myself, I struggle to get along with other south Asians in South Africa. Why? Because majority of them are ignorant to issues surrounding poverty, racism and its link to colonialism and slavery. The only ones who tend be ignorant to these topics are ones who come from an extremely privileged background. They have no care to social issues because they find that it does not affect them. The attitude involves the sense of “if I’m rich and comfortable now, why should I care about everyone else who isn’t”. Now, this mentally is not just restricted to one race, it is open to everyone. But this is personal to ME and MY racial group because it affects me deeply and prevents me from even getting along with my own family </p>
            <h3>COLOURISM</h3>
            <p>In the south Asian community, many people praise and value people with a fairer skin tone. Again, most of them are ignorant to the fact that this is an ideology carried over by the effects of colonialism. Often, when I’ve tried to explain this to them, they get offended and claim “ not it has nothing to do with colonialism” but then my question is THEN WHY DO YOU THINK HAVING FAIR SKIN IS BETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE??? I understand that these are intense topics and I’m not saying we need to look at the past and be angry – I’m saying people need to be aware of things so that they can understand their sense of privilege.
</p>
            <h3>EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SOUTH ASIAN -THESE ISSUES STILL APPLY </h3>
            <p>Now, those were topics that influenced me into becoming interested in addressing them in the first place. It would be difficult for a non- south Asian person or even a south-Asian person who has not experienced the same thing as me to even understand where I’m coming from. </p>
            <p> Colourism affects all people of colour. It affects them within their family dynamics as well as their dating life. Most south Asian families praise and show favouritism towards the fairer skinned children. Light-skinned people are known to be a dating preference over dark skinned people, within the SAME race.</p>
            <p>I believe that the more people are made aware of these issues, they’ll understand why the same people who face them need to be represented in our modern society. Hopefully, this is addressed in many of blog posts. When we become aware of things, we become even more aware of the problems the things we create can harbour. These things can range from AI facial recognition systems, algorithms, video games etc. Something like AIs are a good example. They are only as smart and aware as the people who create them. Therefore, if an AI is created with racial and sexist ignorance, the AI will produce racist and sexist content</p>
            <p>Another thing to note- a simple "hack" you could say- if you ever want to know more about someone, without asking them, check out their Twitter feed. You can tell A LOT about someone just from what they tweet, retweet and like. It's a simple way of catching out the problematic politics, racism and sexism. That's why the first thing you see when you open my website is my recent Twitter activity. It allows you to see what kind of person I probably am, without dwelling any further.</p>
