       <center><strong><h1>CHARACTER RATIONALE</h1></strong></center>
     
       <p>Heya! It’s the <strong>The Feral Jalapeno</strong>. I’m a South-Asian, South African woman that’s currently attending university. You’ll find topics of things like, privilege, colonialism and sexuality in most of my blog posts. My intentions are to address many of the social issues that exist by pointing them out in areas where most people wouldn’t think to find them.</p>
<p> These places that tend to hold very real, social issues ( such as racial and gender based issues ) can be find in things like video games and even comics. By addressing these issues, we can realize how much the effects of things like, colonialism and slavery, still taint majority of the world. Especially in aspects people tend to believe holds little to none of these issues.</p>
            
            <h3>BUT WHY ARE THESE TOPICS OF ETHICS AND PRIVILIGE IMPORTANT TO ME</h3>
            <p> These topics are important because, personally, I have observed how people who tend to come from a place of privilege, are often ignorant to others who are not. People have the idea that if something is not directly affecting them or if they do not see it – then it doesn’t exist. Being South-Asian myself, I struggle to get along with other south Asians in South Africa. Why? Because majority of them are ignorant to issues surrounding poverty, racism and its link to colonialism and slavery. The only ones who tend be ignorant to these topics are ones who come from an extremely privileged background. They have no care to social issues because they find that it does not affect them. The attitude involves the sense of “if I’m rich and comfortable now, why should I care about everyone else who isn’t”. Now, this mentally is not just restricted to one race, it is open to everyone. But this is personal to ME and MY racial group because it affects me deeply and prevents me from even getting along with my own family </p>
            
            <p>In the south Asian community, many people praise and value people with a fairer skin tone. Again, most of them are ignorant to the fact that this is an ideology carried over by the effects of colonialism. Often, when I’ve tried to explain this to them, they get offended and claim “ not it has nothing to do with colonialism” but then my question is THEN WHY DO YOU THINK HAVING FAIR SKIN IS BETTER IN THE FIRST PLACE??? I understand that these are intense topics and I’m not saying we need to look at the past and be angry – I’m saying people need to be aware of things so that they can understand their sense of privilege.
 If you look at my blog post on the Mass Effect trilogy, you’ll see how decolonisation is still extremely evident in modern media (video games). </p>
            <h3>EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT SOUTH ASIAN -THESE ISSUES STILL APPLY </h3>
            <p>Now, those were topics that influenced me into becoming interested in addressing them in the first place. It would be difficult for a non- south Asian person or even a south-Asian person who has not experienced the same thing as me to even understand where I’m coming from. </p>
            <p> So let me give you a more understandable example – look at people and their behaviour due the COVID-19 outbreak. Thousands of people were clearing the shelves of groceries, from toilet paper to Oros … OROS ! People knew that the government warned the country against panic buying and that it’s absolutely ridiculous, yet they still queued outside stores for hours and cleared the shelves. But why did they do that? Because they can. Because they have the finances to buy an unnecessary amount of groceries. Because they have the privilege to be selfish. It is a privilege to have the ability to clear out a stores stock and leave a person who desperately needs a limited number of essentials to be stranded with nothing. People don’t understand and may not agree with this, but it’s true. The only reason you would overstock your cupboards and potentially disadvantage someone else who cannot do the same – is because you financially are able to do so. </p>
            <p> To understand the topics of privilege in a different situation,
