        <h1>MAKING A FEMINIST INTERNET IN AFRICA: WHY THE INTERNET NEEDS AFRICAN FEMINISTS AND FEMINISMS</h1>
<p> An article by Sheena Magenya discusses how Covid-19 and it’s global pandemic has cancelled many gatherings and meetings. She notes how many people say that the quick and easy solution is to just meet online. She points out that this is an issue.
     “Presenting the internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of communication silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use and representation on the internet which is false.” 
This statement is very true. There is a massive stream of inequality when it comes to internet access- especially in Africa. 
Information involving that in more detail can be found in my other blog post-<a href= https://feraljalapeno.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827492/Blogs/Week_11/blogs_information_geographies.html> a study of information geographies</a> 

 </p>
<p>The global pandemic has affected the gatherings of femenists in Africa quite a bit. Magenya explains how the All Women Count-Take Back The Tech! (AWC-TBTT!) project at the Association for Progressive Communications Women’s Rights Programme (APC WRP) decided 
    to host a Making a Feminist Internet in Africa and the Diaspora (MFIAfrica) gathering in October 2019. The intention was to bring a diverse group of African activists, artists and feminists together. They discussed the internet and the power and impact it had 
    on their lives. It was the first time this sort of gathering happened in Africa, for African feminists and activists. </p>
<p>The meetings first occurred in 2014 when the WRP wanted to find out how technology was affecting the realities of women, LGBTQA people as well as people with disabilities. Since the first Imagine a Feminist meeting in 2014, there has been major changes in internet 
    and technology usage. The article states that Kenya, an African country, increased it’s active internet users to 15 million users. These numbers are more visible on social media platforms. There are a few more women’s voices being heard, mainly because of the increased
     reporting of gender-based violence online. An example of this would be women on Twitter sharing their abuse stories and people supporting them by retweeting their story, expanding on it as well as calling out the abusers. This speed in technological change has affected how our societies function. 
     Online issues don’t seem to have an off-line presence. Magenya refers to online gender-based violence and how it has been brought up by many women and LGBTQA people. The issue is that many African countries lack the legislation that recognises as well as acts on these attacks. Due to this, the online space appears 
     to be a safer space to abuse women rather than it being a safe space for women. This leads onto how the internet can appear to be a new type of world that is in danger of repeating the oppressive norms of the past. She then states that “The inequality of access to and representation on the internet is 
     fast replicating existing oppression and suppression. Africa’s particular voice and history in this dynamic needs to be a loud and powerful narrative that shifts the dominant white tide towards a different and more inclusive internet.” If you look at my blog post on
<a href= https://feraljalapeno.github.io/WSOA3028A_1827492/Blogs/Week_11/blogs_information_geographies.html> a study of information geographies</a> 
as mention before, you will see how great the inequality of access is in Africa. That paper shows how majority of African countries struggle to pay for access to the internet while the countries that are built off using them as
 slaves and resource pools, have the most access to the internet. Magenya addresses how Africa still portrays visible evidence of its western colony history. The aspect of power and oppression still exist.  The western world views Africa as a space to test their drugs illegally. 
 She tells us how, in the State of Kano, Nigeria, the pharmaceutical giant – Pfizer illegally tested their drugs on children and caused their disabilities or death. You can read more here : 
 <a href= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/jun/05/health.healthandwellbeing1 >Nigeria sues Pfizer for $7bn over 'illegal' tests on children</a> 
 This is just ONE example. Africa has plenty of stories scattered across its lands on how western countries have little to no regard of the continents people.</p>
<p>Magenya also discusses how Africa is always seen as a beneficiary of technology and not an innovator. I find this hilarious considering that almost every country responsible for such “innovation” only managed to get to where they are now because they stole and ripped apart these African countries for their own selfish gain. 
    Technology in Africa seems to be something that changes the lives of Africans, such as combatting droughts and famine. This leads to the narratives of the people being tucked away. Thankfully, this is changing. Magenya says we have African feminists to thank for this change. It is so important to have more African feminists 
    taking up a space on the internet and sharing alternatives views and opinions. The internet helps shape how people think and how they perceive themselves and others. With more diversity taking a space, more people can accept themselves for who they are and learn about other perspectives and help support others. As Magenya says, it is crucial to have more of these African feminist voices on the internet. It is the one possible way we can push for diversity and awareness on a global platform. </p>
