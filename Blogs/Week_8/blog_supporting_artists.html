<center><h3>why you have no excuse to support any of your friends who are artists</h3></center>

<p> We all know that stigma around artists. The “starving” artist as we call it. But, have you ever wondered why most artists struggle? Why most of them can’t make ends meet through their artistic passion? It’s because they don’t really have much support from their friends or family. Unfortunately, most people believe that the only way you can support an artist is by buying their artworks. Then people have excuses of finances and not having a use for the artworks if they did end up buying them. But I’m here to tell you that is all rubbish. Everything you can do to help support an artist is – FREE. That’s right, everything you can do to significantly help a fellow artist is all free. So hold onto your coins because you won’t be spending them here! </p>
<p> So what can you do to support an artist? Specifically, what can you do for <em>free</em>. Remember the word free is the only reason most people should care anyway… 
<br>
1.	You can like their post of their art on their socials. With the way social algorithms work, your like on their post could potentially spread their post to more feeds and expose them to more people and maybe even potential customers. It’s a simple task we do all the time and it could be more impactful than you realise
<br>
2.	Share their post once you’ve liked it. You can simply post it to your Instagram story or share it with your other friends privately. This is important because its giving the artist exposure to more people.
<br>
3.	Comment on their posts. Engagement on these posts also help with the algorithms and spreading the posts in the feeds of others. </p>
<p>SEE? How simple? something most of us do on the daily on multiple posts – so why not help a friend out, for freeeeeee. Let me show you an example of supporting an artist friend:</p>

<p> During the first moments of lockdown, my friend Suharni did this digital painting of me. She did a few of her friends and sent it to us. Now, even though she just did it for fun, all of us posted her digital paintings of us on our social media. Most importantly, we tagged her accounts in the posts as well. This is not just us expressing our gratitude and appreciation for her gesture, but also us supporting her as a creative. This all cost nothing financially but helped with giving her exposure as an artist. </p>
