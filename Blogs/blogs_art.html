<center><h3>There’s a reason why no one really cares about iconic celebrities on the app</h3></center>

<p>Before you cringe - just give me a chance to explain.Tiktok is a rapidly growing platform. The focus of this platform is on how  its main feed often surfaces everyday users — aka, amateurs — doing something cute, funny or clever. Ordinary people have gained a sense of popularity and have been recognised as creative contributors just by creating content on the app. </p>
<p>“Digital Storytelling therefore works to ‘remediate’ vernacular creativity in new media contexts: it is based on everyday communicative practices – telling personal stories, collecting, and sharing personal images – but remixed with the textual idioms of television and film; and transformed into publicly accessible culture through the use of digital tools for production and distribution.” ( Jean Burgess, p.g 3) </p>
