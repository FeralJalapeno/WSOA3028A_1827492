        <h1>DRAGON AGE: INQUISITION</h1>
        <h2>An analysis on how players can connect with their avatar</h2>
        <p> These are the kinds of things that I genuinely enjoy writing. It combines my love for games with my interest
            in addressing things,such as topics around LGBTQA, and why representation of these things in video games matter.
        In my first two years of university, my degree covered important topics like this very heavily in our theory.   
    Currently, I don't get to discuss many video games in my work- so I wanted to bring some of it here. It was quite nostalgic
to go back and look at the MDA framework, which was first introduced to me in my first year. Anyway, let's get on with it:</p>
            <p>Dragon Age: Inquisition is an open world, role- playing game (RPG) which was developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The game is available to play on PC, Xbox one, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 and 4 platforms. It was released in November of 2014 and is the third instalment of the Dragon Age video game series. The game was awarded with The Game of the Year award in the year 2014 as well as Best Role-Playing Game award in the year 2015[1]. I will discuss the game and analyse it in pair with the MDA framework. This will identify the core aesthetics of the game along with the dynamics and mechanics that these core aesthetics consists of. </p>
            <p>The MDA (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) analysis encounters 8 major aesthetics – fantasy, narrative, sensation, fellowship, submission, expression, challenge and discovery. This aesthetics are ways of describing games with their specific qualities and aspects [2]. The game, Dragon Age: Inquisition, mainly has the aesthetic components of fantasy, discovery expression and fellowship. </p>
            <p>The fantasy aspect is evident in the overall design and theme of the game. The game leans towards the obvious fantasy themes that differ greatly from the real world yet use real world concepts. An example of this would be the game referring to religious group known as the Chantry who refer to the God-like figure of the game’s world as “The Maker”. The other fantasy aspects include typical fantasy orientated things such as mages, dwarves and dragons as well as many other aspects unique to the game trilogy. Of course, the combat also adds to this fantasy, especially since majority of the combat options have a magical aspect to them. Unfortunately, the combat system relies mainly on the same buttons/keys to attack with no button/key combos leaving the combat to feel very physically repetitive but visually entertaining.</p>
            <p>The discovery aesthetic comes mainly from the game being an open world. The game has fourteen different area maps for the player to explore. Each map is available to the player through the main world map. Certain area maps only become available as the story progresses. Each area is vastly different from the other. Each area map opens more to the discovery aspect as more characters, lore, creatures and many other discoverable aspects are unique to each area. Enemies and certain milestones within the game are spread out throughout all the areas. The higher the player’s level, the more intricate and challenging the areas become. Below are images that show an example of how different the area maps are, which benefit to the level of variety and discovery the game has to offer.</p>

            <p> The expression aspect of the game offers a variety of ways in which the player can express themselves. A common aspect in role-playing games is to give the player choices and decisions to make which can lead multiple outcomes within the game’s storyline. A major point in player expression is the player having the agency to create their own character. The game offers quite an extensive character creator tool for the player to work with. It offers simple varieties of different hairstyles to multiple sliders to manipulate and change the characters facial structure. The somewhat allows the player to feel more connected to their character as they play the game and can therefore experience events with thee character on a deeper level. The romance aspect in the game offers the player a great amount of this connection expression. 
                The player has eight different characters to pursue a romantic interest with, but they can also choose to pursue no one. These dialogue choices and actions the player chooses can change their relationships with characters as well as the games cutscenes and ending. But, the main aspect of expression would be sexuality in the romance context. Besides players having the ability to experience playing as a different “race” and gender within the game, they can also experience different aspects of sexuality. By this, it is meant that a player themselves could identify as a heterosexual female but within the game, they could then choose to have their character be a bisexual male. This sense of expression is implemented as certain characters that the player can romance, have their own sexualities. Meaning, that certain characters are 
                strictly homosexual while others are heterosexual or bisexual. Players can find out this information as they interact with the characters, which links to the discovery aesthetic. </p>

            <p>Image showing screenshot of character creation and the variety of choices the player is given in manipulating their character’s eye appearance.[5]</p>
            
            <p>The fellowship aesthetic is implemented by the dynamic of the player having three characters travel with them throughout the game. These characters help vastly in combat. Even though the player has complete control over all the characters and can switch between them at any given time, unless one is dead during the combat, in tougher combat situations the player if forced to tactically play out their combat in order to keep everyone in their party alive. Arguably, this sense of fellowship is not for the player to interact with other players, but rather to immerse themselves deeper into the game and build a deeper connection with the characters through their own character. With this, the players feel more obligated to protect their party members, especially if a party member is one that they are romancing.</p>
            <p>Dragon Age Inquisition is a vast open world, role-playing game that uses its dynamics and mechanics to allow the player to deeply connect with their custom character and therefore sympathise and relate to the rest of the characters in the game. This allowance of agency and ability to connect shows that the game relies on these aspects heavily in order to have a player deeply enjoy and interact with the game to its full potential.</p>
