        <h1>MASS EFFECT TRILOGY </h1>
<h2>An analysis discussing Expression and Decolonising in the trilogy </h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p> Mass Effect is an action, role- playing game that was developed by Bioware and published by Electronic Arts (EA). The game then had three more instalments released but this essay will discuss the first three Mass Effect games only. All three of these games received the VGX Award for Best RPG. This essay will identify and discuss one core aesthetic of the game as well as the mechanics and dynamics within this aesthetic. I will then explore how this aesthetic relates to decolonising games the game in terms of race and how the game lacks in diversity which contributes to severely underrepresenting people of colour. </p>
<h3>Core Aesthetics:</h3>
<p> The MDA (mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics) framework identifies eight major aesthetics – fantasy, narrative, sensation, fellowship, submission, expression, challenge and discovery. The main aesthetics are used to describe games that touches on a game’s specific quality. The main aesthetic that will be discussed in this essay is expression since is it very vast in the games. </p>
<h3>Expression:</h3>
 <p> The expression aspect of the game is offered mainly through the role-playing aspect of the game. All three games do offer some customisation in terms of appearance but there is not an abundance of changes that can be made. The games do come with QuickStart characters which are present in the game trailers and box art. The role-playing expression is enhanced by players being able to choose the history, military profile as well as psychological profile of their character. These choices affect the game in terms of dialogue and combat styles that the player will experience, offering some uniqueness to each option. </p>

<p> A unique aspect that the three Mass Effect games hold is that players can upload gameplay data from one game and export it into the next game instalment. This is available due to the first to third game continuing/ progressing from the previous game instalment to the next. This allows players to dwell more into the game’s world and feel more connected and invested to it. Previous choices made in, say, Mass Effect 1 (ME1), will then carry over into Mass Effect 2 (ME2). For example, nonplayable characters (NPCs) that the player was not on good terms with or any character’s they romanced in ME1, this information would carry over onto ME2. This aids greatly towards the role-playing aspect of the game since it allows the player to have their story flow through all three games. </p>
 <p>The main dynamic that contributes to the expression aesthetic is allowing the player to be an individual within the game. By this it is meant that the player can physically make changes within the game world that is fuelled by their own choices. This is a common aspect found in RPGs. This creates the major point where a player has agency when it comes to the story progression and outcomes of situations. This dynamic’s purpose is to create the expression aesthetic. </p>
<p>As players play and progress within the game, they are faced with a variety of choices that can lead to different outcomes in situations which can also lead towards affecting the main plots of the story. An example of this would be where the player must essentially decide, in the first game, the fate between two of their crew members – Kaiden and Ashley. The player must decide which crew member to send 5 off to support the Salarian. Depending on the players decision, the crew member they send off to support the Salarian will die and the other crew member will live. This heavily impacts the games story as an entire character will permanently be gone in-game. If the player uploads their game data onto ME2, the same character that died will remain dead and the game will continue without them. With this example, players can truly feel as if they have left their personal “mark” on the game as their choice affected the game in such a way.</p>
<p> Expression is also implemented by the romance aspect in the game. The first game offers a very limited romance selection but as the next game continues, the romance selection expands. The player can choose to romance these characters, or they can choose not to. The player is served with dialogue choices that can affect their relationship with the characters and even influence cut scenes and the game endings. The main aspect of expression is the sexuality within the romance context. Besides players having the ability to make major choices within the game that affect the games story that can continue throughout all three games, players can also experience different aspects of sexuality. This means that players themselves could identify as a homosexual male but within the game, they could choose to have their character be a heterosexual female. This form of expression is implemented as certain characters within the game have their own sexualities. This means that some characters can strictly be heterosexual, and some are bisexual. </p>
<h3> Decolonising: </h3> 
<p>The Mass Effect games are arguable diverse in the sense that players can customise their characters and change their skin tone but, the trilogies default characters are white. As discussed earlier, the game comes with QuickStart character, Shepard, to play as. These characters, both male and female, are white. The game trailers that released before the game was even out on store shelves, as well as the game’s box art (see Image 1), depict the white, male Shepard character. The default design on the box art depicts a white male across all three games. The study “Diversity in Gaming” buy Curry’s PC world also discusses this very same example and acknowledges that even though RPGs, just like Mass Effect, may offer 6 choices – the default characters are predominantly white. The default characters that are white in RPGS make up 61%. </p>
<p>The first game, ME1, only offers white human romance options – Kaiden and Ashley. Out of all three games, there are only three human characters of colour that are romanceable. Yes, there are many other alien romance options, but they do not aid the game in any way by being more diverse. The game does well in having diverse sexualities but performs poorly when it comes to racial diversity. </p>

<p>The unfortunate part is that the games do show racial issues and conflict. The game has its own world of different alien species. The game shows how different species fight each other for power or how one species looks down on the other. This can be seen to emulate racial and xenophobic conflicts in the real world. The alien races within the Mass Effect games can be seen to symbolize real societal issues. The ironic part is that while the game does its best to portray these situations in its own way without using human races and rather fictional ones, the default Shepard character is a white male. During gameplay, the player is faced with many situations where they need to resolve the conflict between the two different species/races in the game.</p>
<p> By the default character being a white male, this situation leans towards the “White Man’s Burden” concept where a message about the white race is superior and is responsible to setting order to all other races (Brantlinger, P. p.g 172-191). A good example of this is the Krogan species genophage within the game. The genophage is a biological weapon that was created by the Turians , another species in the game. This weapon was designed to infect the Krogan species and force a genetic mutation within the species that severely reduced the birth rate. This was done due to The Krogan species being in rebellion. The species had a rapid population growth which meant there were more of them to fight even when they faced many casualties. The weapon was successful as it severely diminished the Krogan species. The Turians were recruited by the Council who eventually rewarded 8 the Tuarians with a seat at the Council. The Krogan were left to suffer the effects genophage. Although this situation here is heavily dramatized, it holds real-life issues. The Council in the games is basically a group that holds incredible power. They seek aid from another group, the Turians, and in return give them power if they can successfully diminish the Krogans current power. </p>
<p> Everything here is just power play, where one group needs more power over the other. While the groups in power thrive, the species without power is left to suffer. With this issue, the player eventually finds themselves trying to fix issues caused by the conflict therefore echoing this “White Mans Burden” concept. The three Mass Effect games uses its dynamics and it’s ability to carry over data from game to game to give the player an extensive role-playing experience and to therefore feel a connection with the outcomes of their choices. Unfortunately the games do severely lack in diversity, despite the alien races meaning to represent real world racial issues. </p>
