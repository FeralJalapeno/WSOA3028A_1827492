        <h1>The Universality of Comics</h1>
<p>I have realized that majority of my opinions have a link to feminism, race or discussions of power. I want to discuss
    how something like comics, that seem so simple, are actually extremely influential. The context of these comics can be very 
    important and even empowering. Many people scoff at me when I link " average things", such as comics, to topics of 
    empowerment, sexuality and feminism to name a few. These topics do matter and I want to tell you why it does.
</p>
<p>We live in a society where visual communication is at its peak. Meaning that our society is so well conversed in symbols and their meanings that something like comics, with their basic forms, are widely understood and well interpreted on a universal scale. Yet, despite the imagery being well understood and readers can relate to what is being portrayed, it has come to a stage where there is a limit to how much readers are able to relate. This limit is reached in an area of gender and race within comics. These days readers want more inclusivity and what to relate to comics on a deeper level that goes beyond seeing themselves in the simplistic forms.</p>
<p>To start this level of relation, Scott McCloud explains how comics cause readers to relate to the comic they read; “When you look at a photo or realistic drawing of a face – you see the face of another. But when you enter the world of the cartoon – you see yourself.” (Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics, Chapter 2, p.g 36)Due to the simplistic form of comics (of course not including the heavily realistic art styles in this case) readers instinctively recognise themselves and therefore relate to the cartoon. A prime example of comics that are popular in today’s time is by Shen Comix/ Owlturd Comix. The simplistic nature of this comics style makes it easy for majority of people who read the comic to engage and relate themselves directly to the context. Below is an example of one of the many comics available online.</p>

<p>This comic can engage effectively with majority of people that see it due to its online platform as well as it’s simplistic art style. As McCloud said, this simplistic cartoon style of comics allows people to relate themselves directly to the comics context. Looking at the provided comic, the personification on the laptop along with the simple art style on the man allows readers to relate to losing their own hours of sleep due to being on their laptops. This is what draws so much attraction to these comics. There has always been criticism on how something with such lacking detail and mediocre art skill could gain so much popularity while something that is hyper realistic does not receive half as much of the attention. This is all due to viewers being able to relate to the context of the comic.</p>
<p>Yet, when there is more complexity in a comic it becomes far less universal. This can be seen within popular comics, such as those belonging to the Marvel and DC universe. Although many of the comics have mass popularity, popularity that has been growing through the ages of the comics growth and change, in today’s time people want more. Of course, it is undeniable that characters such as Spider Man and Wonder Woman have a global fan base, but their complexity makes it harder for people to relate themselves into the context of the comic. Besides the comic’s context locations causing a block in allowing people to relate, gender and race are one of the main issues. The world has progressed so much and so has people’s mindsets and expectations for more inclusion and representation of the “real-world”. </p>
<p>When I say the “real-world”, it is not meant that people wish to see less fantasy and more realism, but rather would like to see an inclusion of more realistic women and races being portrayed in comics. We can argue that there are plenty of women in popular comics that take on centre stage. To name a few there are Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Super Woman and many others. But all these female comic characters have one concerning thing in common- they are all white women. Of course, we have other powerful female characters such as Nakia and Shuri from Black Panther who are not white. But these women are only side characters that stand next to the main male character. Yes, the sudden rise in popularity of Black Panther has given people of colour greater representation but the issue of lacking women of colour as comic heroes remains.</p>
<p>With this lack of inclusivity, Marvel has introduced a new female character- Kamala Khan as Ms. Marvel. The important aspect of this character is that she is the first every Muslim, female character to be introduced by such a popular franchise. This is a great step in allowing more people to relate to the comic universe of Marvel. By allowing readers who may also be female and Muslim to have such a character available to them, they can relate themselves to the comic to a deeper degree despite the complexity.</p>
<p>Regarding empowerment, Indian women found such in the adult webcomic Savita Bhabhi. This is an adult comic that enters extremely provocative topics, yet it caused a surge in approval to Indian women despite the expected audience approval to solely come from men. Indian women feel empowered by such a comic as the comic depicts a housewife named Savita Bhabhi who has the complete opposite character of how Indian women are expected to behave and act with Indian society. Women found that the comic depicted a woman of an Indian society that finally was not portrayed as the perfect, innocent women that the society feeds to its people. Finally, there was a female character who was powerful and had control in her decisions to not bind to the societies ideas that she should be a subservient housewife who only serves the needs of her husband and not her own. This character is seen as powerful by Indian women because she has independency and the free will to make her own decisions regarding her sexuality and lifestyle and not because she has any non-human, fantasy-based powers as seen in Western comic characters. Indian society to this day is still extremely patriarchal and still feeds women the mentality that if they pursue their desires, they will be punished for it. Yet a simple comic depicting a female character that goes against this mentality caused a mass number of women to relate to the comic and feel empowered.</p>
<p>It can clearly be seen that there are different ways readers can relate to a comic and there are different things readers want to relate to. Shen Comix provides a larger scale of universal relating by readers due to the simplistic and straight forward style while other comics serve to cause readers to relate on a deeper level, specifically involving race and gender. While the comic character Kamala Khan can create a larger canvas of inclusivity and move past the representation of all white, female characters, an unlikely comic such as Savita Bhabhi can have mass relation towards the empowerment of women in such a strict, patriarchal society. With our society expanding so rapidly into becoming so visually aware and understanding symbols universally, the aspect of relating to comics is moving towards a much deeper context.</p>
