    <center><p><h1>THE ETHICS OF UX PRACTICE</h1></p></center>
<h3><center>creating anything? consider the usability, the UX</center></h3>
<p>So we had a lecture on UX and it was really eye opening. It gave me an intellectual outlook on how to describe why some things are great and why they downright SUCK. You’ll see what I mean by this later…</p>
<p> During the lecture, it was stated that UX is commonly referred to the usability of designed objects- how usable and easy it is to use. So some guy, Araz, stated that user experience revolves around three aspects: <br>
1.	Subjectivity <br>
2.	Contributing Agents<br>
3.	Difference between singular and accumulated experiences</p>
<p>
Briefly discussing these aspects: subjectivity refers to UX being identified as the user’s experience with their interactions with the object. This is due to the user’s interaction with the design object and NOT the design of the object. 
</p>
<p>The contributing agents involve the user, object and context. The user refers to the user experience and it’s subjectivity. Experiences vary amongst users for various reasons. The object can refer to services and not just physical things. It is required for UX to occur ( duh ). The context refers to the situation the object is interacted in. A variety of things like location and time and even culture can contribute to the context. Singular and accumulated experiences involve users having their experience with the object not just referring to the interactions with the object- but also every interaction that happens before that. Singular experiences is a result of an interaction with a touch point but accumulated experiences is a result of an accumulation of singular experiences. </p>
<p> Check out this video: <a href= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25peayoZOfs > 5 Opening Kitchen Gadgets Improved by Design Expert </a> <br>
This video shows a Design and Usability expert, Dan Formosa, testing out various kitchen gadgets. The point of these gadgets it to supposedly make certain kitchen tasks much easier. Now, Formosa tests out every gadget on what they claim to do with ease. He compares using the gadget to by doing the same task manually without the object. Obviously, most of these gadgets are not easy to use. The interesting thing is that he coats his hands in oil when he does a dexterity test on the gadgets. He does this to stimulate a person with a disability ,or any issue using their hands, using the gadget. This method is brilliant. As a designer and usability expert, Formosa considers people with disabilities. This simple method of using oiled hands while using the object immediately depicts whether a gadget is inclusive to disabled people.
</p>
<p>Like I said in the beginning, I now have a theoretical and intellectual approach to explain why something is either great or if it sucks - based of the lecture and the videos of
    Dan Formosa.
